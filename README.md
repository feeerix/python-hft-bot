I'm a bit of an idiot, but I wanted a way to download large amounts of kline data.
Through implementing this I'm hoping to larn more about building large python projects.

## Potential Roadmap

First thing I want to do is to set up the ability to get as much kline data as we can, as well as running a local orderbook.
I have found this implementation:

Which is an implementation of this quant cup winner apparently

Hopefully, I wish to generalise this as much as possible, so that we can spread this out across 2-3 centralised exchanges.
Once this is done, I hope I can set up some way to check the prices for decentralised exchanges.
