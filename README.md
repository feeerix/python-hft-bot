# HFT Bot

This is the basis of a backtesting structure 

## To Do List

- Add ability for positions to have custom conditions for each position
- Create logic for creating a position
- Make sure we can add onto an existing position (like averaging in etc)
- Check logic for actually executing a position vs backtesting
- make sure to know we can record our positions
- integrate websocket into normal backtesting (live testing)
- check performance
